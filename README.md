## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, with instructions for this code test.

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page.

## Tasks

- Please clone this repo from github into a glitch project and share the URL with us.

- Please move doses.csv into a folder called `data` and correct the code to point to it.

- Please write a message to the console with the value of any variable. Check that you can view your message with the live site open in a new browser window.

- Please add Dose 3 to the bar chart: Add 100,000 doses for Dose 3. Please color it a darker shade of blue.

- Implement the `add_bar_labels` function. The function should take the labels from the data and place them in the SVG similar to the counts beneath the bars.

- Please add an explanatory note to the HTML for the third dose to the chart.

- Please change some aspect of the styling in CSS.

- Please upload your final work to github.
